[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*]remove items from trader.
[/list]

[h1]Description[/h1]
This is a heavily stripped-down version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] that only allows you to remove weapons, not add them.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] has no chance of being whitelisted, but this version has a chance because it can't add anything unbalanced to the game - and that's the only reason this version exists.
If we're lucky with that then server operators will have more tools to fine-tune the server.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b] But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[b]⚠️ I submitted whitelist request here:[/b]

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Open console (~) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=LTI.LTIMut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]
[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
❗️ If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ❗️
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864857909[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait until the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=LTI.LTIMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Important setup information[/h1]
The config should be created on first start, but now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ​​randomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ​​or not be created at all.
So if you are using this mutator for the first time, I highly recommend doing the following:
[olist]
[*]Create (modify) [b]KFLTI.ini[/b] manually. Put the following content there:
[b][LTI.LTI]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start the game/server with LTI to generate the contents of the config
[*]Close the game/server
[/olist]
[b]Right now this is the only way to correctly create the default config.[/b]
Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste).
[*]Use [b][LTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.
[*]Set [b]bHRG=True[/b] to remove HRG items.
[*]Set [b]bDLC=True[/b] to remove DLC items.
[/list]
