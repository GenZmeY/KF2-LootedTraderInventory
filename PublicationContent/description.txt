[h1]Description[/h1]
This is a heavily stripped-down version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] that only allows you to remove weapons, not add them.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] has no chance of being whitelisted, but this version has a chance because it can't add anything unbalanced to the game - and that's the only reason this version exists.
If we're lucky with that then server operators will have more tools to fine-tune the server.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b] But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [b]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFLTI.ini[/b]
with the following content:
[b][LTI.LTI]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Open console (~) and start any map with LTI (this will generate the default KFLTI.ini content):
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=LTI.Mut[/b]
[*]Close the game and configure LTI as you need (see the [b]Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/b] section below);
[*]Start KF2, open the console, start the game:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=LTI.Mut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need).
[/olist]
[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
❗️ If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ❗️
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864857909[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]When the download is complete, close the server;
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [b]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFLTI.ini[/b]
with the following content:
[b][LTI.LTI]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=LTI.Mut[/b] and start the server (this will generate the default KFLTI.ini content);
[*]Close the server and configure LTI as you need (see the [b]Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/b] section below);
[*]Start the server (with [b]?Mutator=LTI.Mut[/b]) again.
[/olist]

[h1][b](*)[/b] Buggy config variables initialization[/h1]
LTI, like many other mutators, initializes the config by relying on the unreal script feature which uses default values for each data type that is not explicitly specified. For the int type (which is used to store the config version) this is zero - detecting zero allows to understand that the mutator is being used for the first time (which means it's need to generate a config). But now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ​​randomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ​​or not be created at all. This is why I recommend explicitly set [b]Version=0[/b] in the config for the first time.

Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste) or leave it [b]False[/b] if you want a clean config without unnecessary things.
[*]Use [b][LTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.
[*]Set [b]bHRG=True[/b] to remove HRG items.
[*]Set [b]bDLC=True[/b] to remove DLC items.
