[h1]Features[/h1]

[*]remove items from trader.

[h1]Description[/h1]
This is a heavily stripped-down version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] that only allows you to remove weapons, not add them.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] has no chance of being whitelisted, but this version has a chance because it can't add anything unbalanced to the game - and that's the only reason this version exists.
If we're lucky with that then server operators will have more tools to fine-tune the server.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[b]⚠️ I submitted whitelist request here:[/b]

[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
❗️ If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ❗️
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864857909[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait until the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=LTI.LTIMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/h1]
Config will be created at the first start[b]*[/b].
[list]
[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste).
[*]Use [b][LTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.
[/list]

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b](*)[/b] If your config is not created for some reason, create it manually with the following content:
[b][LTI.LTI]
Version=0
[/b]

Then start the server and check the file again - config content should be generated.
