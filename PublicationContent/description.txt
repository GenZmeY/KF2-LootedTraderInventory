[h1]üìã Description[/h1]
This is a heavily stripped-down version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] that only allows you to remove weapons, not add them.
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830826239]CTI[/url] has no chance of being whitelisted, but this version has a chance because it can't add anything unbalanced to the game - and that's the only reason this version exists.
If we're lucky with that then server operators will have more tools to fine-tune the server.

[h1]‚ú® Features[/h1]
[list]
[*]Remove items from trader
[/list]

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

But I hope that it will be whitelisted - I submitted whitelist request here:

[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)

[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864857909[/code]

[h1]üêû (*) Buggy config initialization[/h1]
This mutator (like many others) relies on UnrealScript's default values (0 for int type) to detect first-time use and generate a config.
However, the game contains a bug that initializes unset values to random data, which can lead to incorrect settings or missing configs.

As a workaround, I recommend explicitly setting [b]Version=0[/b] in the config during the first initialization.

Unfortunately, I can't fix this issue because it's a game engine problem (not the mutator's fault).

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFLTI.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*]Set [b]bOfficialWeaponsList=True[/b] to have an auto-updated list of all official weapons in the config (for a convenient copy-paste) or leave it [b]False[/b] if you want a clean config without unnecessary things.
[*]Use [b][LTI.RemoveItems][/b] to remove items from the trader inventory.
example: [b]Item=KFGame.KFWeapDef_Mac10[/b] will remove MAC10 from sale.
[*]Set [b]bHRG=True[/b] to remove HRG items.
[*]Set [b]bDLC=True[/b] to remove DLC items.

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
